# ALC_4.0
My projects


Part of the ALC #5DaysofCodesChallenge, was asked to create an app tha the main activity contains two buttons.
The two buttons gets you to different activities too.
Creating this wasn't easy though, still a newbie to Android Develeopment, faced lots of bugs and all.
Will still work on improving this project.
